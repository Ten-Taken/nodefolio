# nodefolio
An Express app I built to power my development portfolio.

## About
**Author**: _Gregory Wolfe (ten-taken)_

The purpose of this repository is to teach myself node.js in conjunction with two new frameworks,
while redesigning my portfolio website. All learning modules have been moved into aptly 
named sub-directories.  The root level is the app for my site.

Documentation standards TBD prior to v 1.0.
