## About
**Author**: _Gregory Wolfe (ten-taken)_

The purpose of this repository is to teach myself node.js in conjunction with a front-end web js framework,
while rebuilding / redesigning my portfolio website.  The site previously utilized the WordPress CMS as a 
custom-built theme.

Commenting throughout the project files will be for my personal learning needs, and for interested parties to follow along.
Documentation standards TBD prior to v 1.0.
